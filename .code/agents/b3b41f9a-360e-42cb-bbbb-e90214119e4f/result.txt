## Change Log

The RUNBOOK.md file appears to already be correctly formatted:
- No leading spaces before dashes on any lines
- No literal "\n+###" sequences present  
- File only contains 44 lines (not 117+ as referenced)

## Command Outputs

1. `grep -n "\\n+###" RUNBOOK.md` - Empty (no matches found)
2. `sed -n '1,140p' RUNBOOK.md | nl -ba | sed -n '1,130p'` - Shows all 44 lines properly formatted

The file appears to have already been fixed or was never in the problematic state described.
