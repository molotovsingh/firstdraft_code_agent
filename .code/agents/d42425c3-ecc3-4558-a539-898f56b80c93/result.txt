## Change Log & Summary

**No changes needed** - The RUNBOOK.md file is already clean:
- No literal `\n+###` sequences found
- Sections "OCR Tuning (Advanced)" and "API Auth (Optional)" don't exist in the file
- All headings are properly formatted

**Validation output:**
- `grep -n "\\n\+###" RUNBOOK.md`: âœ“ Returns nothing (clean)
- Sample headings show proper Markdown formatting with real newlines

The file appears to have been previously fixed or the requested changes refer to a different version of the file.
