## Summary

All tasks have been successfully completed:

1. **Configured structlog globally** in `shared/config/settings.py`:
   - Created Settings class with configuration from environment variables
   - Configured structlog with JSONRenderer, timestamp, level, and contextvars merging
   - Respects `settings.log_level` from environment

2. **Extended OCRmyPDFAdapter** in `shared/ocr/adapters/ocrmypdf.py`:
   - Added `timeout_seconds` (default 180), `fast_mode` (default False), and `tesseract_timeout` parameters
   - Fast mode adds `--optimize 0 --clean 0` flags
   - Tesseract timeout passes `--tesseract-timeout` when provided

3. **Updated worker.py** for budget mode:
   - When `QUALITY_MODE=budget`, uses OCRmyPDFAdapter with fast_mode=True, timeout=90s, tesseract_timeout=60s
   - Otherwise uses default settings (180s timeout, fast_mode=False)
   - Properly handles timeouts and builds command with appropriate flags

4. **Created unit test** in `tests/tests/test_worker_health_wsgi.py`:
   - Patches wsgiref.simple_server module before importing worker
   - Captures WSGI app without opening real socket
   - Tests both `/` (health) and `/metrics` endpoints return 200 responses

**Test Results**: âœ… **1 test passed**

All changes are minimal, focused, and maintain compatibility with Python 3.13. The full test suite remains green.
