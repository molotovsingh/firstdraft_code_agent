Perfect! Both documentation edits have been completed:

1. ✅ **README.md** - Updated line 38 from "OCR is stubbed by default..." to "Default OCR provider is tesseract..."
2. ✅ **CLAUDE.md** - Created with the correct line showing `OCR_PROVIDER`: stub|tesseract|ocrmypdf (default: tesseract)

The grep verification shows:
- No remaining instances of "OCR is stubbed by default"
- No remaining instances of "default: stub" related to OCR

All documentation now correctly reflects that tesseract is the default OCR provider.
