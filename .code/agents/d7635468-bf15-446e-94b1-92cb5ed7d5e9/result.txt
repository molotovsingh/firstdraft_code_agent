Perfect! All tests are passing. Let me write a summary of the implemented changes:

## Summary of Implemented Changes

Successfully implemented all requested robustness and DX improvements:

### 1. **Pydantic Models for Validation** 
- Added `PresignRequest` and `FinalizeRequest` models with strict validation
- UUID validation for `tenant_id`
- Non-empty filename validation
- Optional MIME type with default "application/octet-stream"

### 2. **New API Endpoints**
- `POST /v0/uploads/presign`: Returns presigned URL for direct S3 uploads
- `POST /v0/uploads/finalize`: Finalizes upload with SHA256 deduplication
- `GET /v0/version`: Returns app version and git SHA

### 3. **Unit Tests**
- Created comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Happy paths for presign and finalize
  - Invalid tenant/user scenarios
  - Missing object on finalize
  - Idempotent finalize with duplicate SHA256
  - Validation errors
  - DB rollback on failures

### 4. **DB Transaction Safety**
- Added `db.flush()` calls after creating FKs in upload and finalize
- Wrapped operations in try/except with `db.rollback()` on failures
- Prevents partial writes on errors

### 5. **Additional Improvements**
- Extended Storage class with `generate_presigned_url()` and `object_exists()`
- Fixed syntax error in worker.py
- Updated to Pydantic V2 field validators
- Added pytest to requirements.txt

All 16 tests passing successfully with minimal, backwards-compatible changes to the existing codebase.
