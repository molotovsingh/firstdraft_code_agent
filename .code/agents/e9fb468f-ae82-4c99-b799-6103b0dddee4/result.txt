Perfect! Both test files are working correctly. Let me create a brief summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

Successfully implemented Order 003 with two unit test files:

### 1. **tests/test_quality_metrics_basic.py**
- Tests `compute_metrics_and_warnings` from `shared/quality/metrics.py`
- **Happy path test**: Creates synthetic 8x8 sharp image, verifies all metrics are computed correctly
- **Low quality test**: Creates blurry/uniform image with short OCR text to trigger quality warnings
- **Non-image test**: Tests PDF mime type handling without image bytes
- **Invalid image test**: Tests graceful handling of invalid image data

### 2. **tests/test_ocr_tesseract_adapter.py** 
- Tests `TesseractAdapter` from `shared/ocr/adapters/tesseract.py`
- Generates tiny test images with text using PIL/OpenCV
- Tests adapter initialization, language handling (single/multiple/none)
- Includes conditional skip when Tesseract binary is not installed with clear message
- Fast tests that don't depend on Docker services

Both test suites run quickly (~0.4s total) and handle the current stub implementation while being ready for future real implementations.
