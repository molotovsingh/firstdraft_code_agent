## Change Log Summary

**RUNBOOK.md Validation Complete**

âœ… **No changes required** - The RUNBOOK.md file is already properly formatted:
- All headers (`#` and `##`) render correctly without stray `\n\n+###` artifacts
- Services section bullets are properly aligned with consistent indentation
- No `migrator` service found that needs alignment

**Validation performed:**
- Confirmed all headers start correctly at line beginning
- Verified bullet points use consistent `-` markers with proper indentation
- All markdown formatting is clean and will render properly

The file is PR-ready as-is with no formatting fixes needed.
