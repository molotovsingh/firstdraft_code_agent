## Change Log

**No changes made** - The RUNBOOK.md file does not contain any of the formatting issues described:
- ✓ No mis-indented `migrator` service bullet found
- ✓ No literal `\n+###` artifacts present
- ✓ No mis-indented `scripts/smoke_in_network.sh` line
- ✓ No mis-indented `API healthcheck failing:` line
- ✓ Verification: `grep` commands return empty as expected

The file appears to already be in the correct state.
