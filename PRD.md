# FirstDraft v2.0 Legal AI Platform - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

FirstDraft v2.0 is an enterprise-grade modular legal AI platform that replaces paralegal grunt work, not experienced lawyers. The platform focuses on perfecting foundational data extraction (client identity, case background, document inventory, timeline of events) before advancing to insights and advisory features. Built for the Indian legal market with robust document quality handling.

**Core Value Proposition**: "AI Paralegal" - automate time-consuming document processing tasks that currently require paralegals and rookie lawyers, empowering experienced lawyers with clean, reliable foundational data.

## 2. Product Vision & Strategy

### Vision Statement
Automated litigation document discovery with entity-aware processing that lawyers trust.

### Mission Statement  
Help lawyers quickly understand clients, cases, and documents through AI-driven extraction and classification, focusing on data accuracy over legal advice.

### Strategic Positioning
- **Replace**: Paralegal document organization, entity cataloging, timeline construction, fact extraction
- **Empower**: Experienced lawyers with reliable foundational data
- **Avoid**: Legal advice, privilege determinations, case strategy, jurisdiction-specific recommendations

### Key Differentiators
- Foundation-first approach: Perfect data quality before attempting insights
- Indian market optimization: Handles poor document quality gracefully
- Modular architecture: Each block could become standalone product
- Credit-based transparency: Users control cost vs. accuracy tradeoffs

## 3. Target Market & Users
